 * # ipopt-rs
 *
 * This crate provides a safe Rust interface to the [Ipopt](https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt)
 * non-linear optimization library. From the Ipopt webpage:
 *
 * > Ipopt (**I**nterior **P**oint **OPT**imizer, pronounced eye-pea-Opt) is a software package
 * > for large-scale nonlinear optimization. It is designed to find (local) solutions of
 * > mathematical optimization problems of the from
 * >
 * >```verbatim
 * >    min     f(x)
 * >    x in R^n
 * >
 * >    s.t.       g_L <= g(x) <= g_U
 * >               x_L <=  x   <= x_U
 * >```
 * >
 * > where `f(x): R^n --> R` is the objective function, and `g(x): R^n --> R^m` are the
 * > constraint functions. The vectors `g_L` and `g_U` denote the lower and upper bounds
 * > on the constraints, and the vectors `x_L` and `x_U` are the bounds on the variables
 * > `x`. The functions `f(x)` and `g(x)` can be nonlinear and nonconvex, but should be
 * > twice continuously differentiable. Note that equality constraints can be
 * > formulated in the above formulation by setting the corresponding components of
 * > `g_L` and `g_U` to the same value.
 *
 * This crate aims to
 *   - reduce the boilerplate, especially for setting up simple unconstrained problems, and
 *   - prevent common mistakes when defining optimization problems as early as possible.
 *
 *

 *
 * Solve a simple unconstrained problem using L-BFGS: minimize `(x - 1)^2 + (y -1)^2`
